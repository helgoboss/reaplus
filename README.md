# ReaPlus

Modern reactive C++ facade for the REAPER SDK

__Attention:__
- _ReaPlus_ is not maintained anymore because I've moved on to Rust. The successor of ReaPlus is [reaper-rs](https://github.com/helgoboss/reaper-rs), in particular its high-level API.
- I only published this repository because some people wanted to have a look. The code is very unpolished, has no documentation and comments are sparse. There are quite some things about it which I would approach differently today.
